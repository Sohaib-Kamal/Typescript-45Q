// Q12: Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

import { Friends_names, array_length } from "./Q11";
for (let y=0; y < array_length; y++) {console.log(`\n Hello ${Friends_names[y]}! How are you?`)}



// console.log(`\n Hello ${Friends_names[0]}! How are you?`)
// console.log(`\n Hello ${Friends_names[1]}! How are you?`)
// console.log(`\n Hello ${Friends_names[2]}! How are you?`)
// console.log(`\n Hello ${Friends_names[3]}! How are you?`)
